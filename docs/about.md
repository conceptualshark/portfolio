I'm Cole Isaac, a technical writer and editor based in the northeastern US. My goal is to break complex technical information into clearly communicated content; my passion is developing the human and technical workflows that make good documentation great.

In practice, I employ a docs-as-code philosophy to create, manage, and publish documentation for modern platforms, informed by established standards and evolving best practices.

I have formal education in software development, technical writing, and project organization, with an extensive background in research and behavioral science. This combination positions me to lead modern documentation efforts in an increasingly AI-aware landscape: as a comprehensive content author, a systems and information architect, and a thoughtful strategist, capable of thoughtfully integrating technology into both documentation workflows and user experiences.

My work bridges collaboration, education, and technology. Review my [work experience](./resume.md) or [portfolio](./portfolio/index.md) to see these principles in action.

# Enterprise wiki migration: Notion to Confluence

This case study documents an internal project at CoreWeave where some deliverables cannot be publicly shared. The case study presents the challenge, approach, and impact of the initiative. Artifacts included are either anonymized examples or sanitized mockups that preserve confidentiality while demonstrating the scope and structure of the work.

!!! abstract
    **Role:** Primary information architect  
    **Company:** CoreWeave  
    **Timeline:** Q3 2025 (engaged May-August)  

## Challenge

CoreWeave's Notion-to-Confluence migration had stalled in a prolonged pilot phase, with only months remaining before a hard August deadline. The project needed to migrate content for nearly 2,000 users across both personal and team spaces, but lacked clear architecture, migration processes, and leadership to drive completion.

## Approach

I came onto the project in May and quickly identified what was missing: structured project planning, clear information architecture, and documented migration processes. I established these foundations, coordinated stakeholders, and drove execution to meet the August deadline.

- **Architected information hierarchy:** Proposed and implemented the organizational structure for over 50 Confluence spaces, defining how content would be categorized and accessed
- **Developed migration frameworks:** Created processes for space creation, template design, and content rollout that teams could follow independently
- **Led testing initiatives:** Designed tightly scoped testing plans and timelines to evaluate migration tools, enabling data-driven decisions
- **Performed technical execution:** Conducted content migrations requiring IT-adjacent skills that no other team members possessed
- **Accelerated delivery:** Identified timeline risks in June and prioritized critical migration paths to ensure August completion

## Key deliverables

- Information architecture for 50+ Confluence spaces, including plans for discoverability and improved navigation
- Space creation and rollout process documentation
- Confluence template library aligned to organizational needs
- Migration tool testing plans and evaluation criteria
- Content migration execution for critical spaces, including white-glove approaches with high-risk teams
- Transition plan for service continuity and content accessibility

## Impact

This project demonstrated how technical writing leadership extends beyond content creation: I brought information architecture thinking, process design, and technical execution to transform a struggling migration into a successful organizational change.

- **Successfully migrated** the vast majority of content for 2,000 users by the August deadline
- **Established sustainable structure** that enabled teams to create and manage their own spaces post-migration
- **Drove completion of a stalled initiative** by establishing structure, coordinating teams, and executing critical technical work
- **Identified and mitigated critical risks** in the migration plan, including missing backup strategies, inadequate testing protocols, and unaddressed user needs

## Artifacts

### Information Architecture Diagram

Lucidchart or draw.io diagram showing the Confluence space hierarchy. Anonymize by:

- Using generic space names ("Engineering", "Product", "Operations", "Team Spaces", etc.)
- Showing the parent-child relationships and organizational structure
- Including space types (e.g., "Department Spaces", "Project Spaces", "Personal Spaces")
- Demonstrating your architectural thinking without revealing specific team or project names
- Could include color-coding or icons to show different space categories

### Space Template Structure

Screenshot of a Confluence space showing your template organization. Structure could include:

- Template page hierarchy (e.g., "Meeting Notes Template", "Project Brief Template", "RFC Template")
- Page tree navigation showing standardized structure
- Anonymize by using placeholder content in templates
- Shows standardization approach without revealing actual content
- Could be a side-by-side comparison of "before" (chaotic) vs "after" (organized)

### Migration Process Flowchart

Diagram documenting your migration process. Include:

- Decision points (e.g., "Content type?" → "Migrate automatically" vs "Manual review needed")
- Process stages (Planning → Testing → Pilot → Full Rollout → Validation)
- Stakeholder touchpoints and approval gates
- Rollback procedures and contingency paths
- Use generic labels throughout—this shows process thinking, not specific content

### Testing Plan Excerpt

Table or document showing your testing methodology. Structure:

| Migration Tool | Test Criteria | Timeline | Results | Decision |
|---------------|--------------|----------|---------|----------|
| Tool A | Format preservation, link integrity | Week 1-2 | [results] | Selected/Rejected |
| Tool B | Bulk migration speed | Week 2-3 | [results] | Selected/Rejected |

Anonymize by:
- Using generic tool names or tool categories
- Showing your evaluation framework without specific vendor information
- Demonstrates systematic, data-driven decision making

### Project Timeline Visual

Gantt chart or timeline showing project phases:

- January-April: Initial planning (before your involvement)
- May: Assessment and architecture design
- June-July: Accelerated execution
- August: Final migration and validation
- Use annotations to highlight your contributions and key milestones
- Shows project management and timeline compression skills

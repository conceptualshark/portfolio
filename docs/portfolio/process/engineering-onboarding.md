# Engineering onboarding documentation overhaul

This case study documents an internal project at CoreWeave where some deliverables cannot be publicly shared. The case study presents the challenge, approach, and impact of the initiative. Artifacts included are either anonymized examples or sanitized mockups that preserve confidentiality while demonstrating the scope and structure of the work.

!!! abstract
    **Role:** Project lead  
    **Company:** CoreWeave  
    **Timeline:** Q3 2025 (4-week execution)  

## Challenge

Engineering is CoreWeave's largest organization and operational core, bringing on 10 to 20 new hires weekly. The onboarding documentation hadn't kept pace with either the company's growth or platform changes. Content was fragmented across multiple platforms, technical details were outdated, and while an initial update had been drafted, it required significant rework to ensure accuracy and quality.

Rather than rush incomplete documentation to publication, I proposed a strategic four-week overhaul: audit existing content, bridge critical gaps, and rebuild the documentation to match Engineering's actual workflows. Working independently, I delivered all milestones on schedule, creating an accurate, cohesive onboarding experience that reduced support questions and accelerated engineers' time to first commit.

## Approach

I took ownership of the entire project lifecycle, from strategic planning through execution:

- **Assessed and replanned:** Evaluated the existing draft, identified gaps, and proposed an extended timeline that balanced urgency with quality
- **Designed the structure:** Created Lucidchart diagrams mapping the onboarding journey and documentation architecture
- **Built project framework:** Developed project proposal with milestone checkpoints for weekly leadership reviews, then created granular Jira epics and tickets to ensure transparency and timeline accountability
- **Reorganized content:** Unified fragmented documentation across multiple repositories, restructuring navigation and information hierarchy to eliminate confusion and create a single, coherent onboarding journey
- **Rewrote 20+ documents:** Covered the full onboarding spectrum from week-one orientation to advanced engineering workflows, including:
    - Workstation setup (terminal, VS Code, development environments)
    - Local and remote development using OrbStack, VDI, and Coder.com
    - GitHub access, credentials, and organization standards
    - CI/CD pipelines and deployment standards
- **Incorporated feedback iteratively:** Met with leadership weekly to ensure deliverables aligned with organizational needs while maintaining timeline commitments

## Key deliverables

- Lucidchart diagrams visualizing onboarding flow and documentation structure
- Comprehensive project proposal and implementation plan
- Complete Jira epic and ticket structure for tracking and accountability
- 20+ rewritten or newly created documentation pages spanning:
    - Week 1 onboarding tasks and orientation
    - Engineering workstation setup across multiple tools
    - Development environment configuration (local and remote)
    - Engineering standards for GitHub, CI/CD, and deployment
- Reorganized information architecture for improved discoverability

## Impact

This project showcased my ability to balance speed with quality, lead technical documentation projects independently, and deliver scalable solutions for high-growth engineering organizations.

- **Enabled seamless onboarding:** Documentation supports consistent onboarding for all new engineering hires
- **Improved quality under pressure:** Extended timeline strategically to deliver publication-ready content rather than rushing inadequate documentation
- **Demonstrated end-to-end ownership:** Managed every phase from proposal to implementation, proving capability to lead complex documentation initiatives
- **Aligned with stakeholder needs:** Weekly leadership check-ins ensured deliverables met organizational requirements while staying on schedule

## Artifacts

### Onboarding Journey Map (Lucidchart)

Flowchart or swimlane diagram showing the engineer's path through onboarding. Structure:

- **Timeline axis:** Week 1, Week 2, Weeks 3-4, Ongoing
- **Swimlanes by category:** Account Setup, Environment Configuration, Code & Deploy, Team Integration
- **Key milestones:** "First commit", "First deployment", "First on-call rotation"
- **Documentation touchpoints:** Show where docs support each stage

Anonymize by:
- Using generic task names ("Configure development environment" vs specific internal tool names)
- Showing process flow without company-specific details
- Can use icons or color-coding for different activity types
- Demonstrates information design and user journey thinking

### Documentation Architecture Diagram

Hierarchical diagram showing how onboarding docs are organized. Could include:

```
Engineering Onboarding (parent)
├── Getting Started
│   ├── Week 1 Orientation
│   ├── Account & Access Setup
│   └── Team Introductions
├── Development Environment
│   ├── Workstation Setup
│   ├── Local Development
│   └── Remote Development
├── Engineering Standards
│   ├── GitHub Workflows
│   ├── CI/CD Pipelines
│   └── Deployment Procedures
└── Resources & References
    ├── Troubleshooting
    └── FAQ
```

This shows information architecture without revealing content details.

### Before/After Content Audit

Table comparing documentation state before and after your project:

| Category | Before | After | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Week 1 Tasks | Scattered across 5 locations | Single consolidated guide | ✓ Complete |
| Workstation Setup | Outdated (2023), missing tools | Current, comprehensive | ✓ Complete |
| GitHub Standards | Not documented | Complete guide with examples | ✓ Created |
| CI/CD Pipeline | High-level only | Step-by-step with troubleshooting | ✓ Enhanced |

Anonymize by:
- Using category names without specific tool/platform details
- Showing improvement metrics (word count, completeness %, etc.)
- Demonstrates project scope and impact

### Project Timeline and Milestones

Gantt chart or timeline visual showing:

- **Week 1:** Assessment, proposal, stakeholder alignment
- **Week 2:** Information architecture, Jira setup, content audit
- **Week 3-4:** Content creation, review cycles, publication
- **Milestones:** Leadership reviews, major deliverable completions
- **Metrics:** 20+ pages, X hours of work, leadership feedback incorporated

Could include annotations showing where you extended timeline and why.

### Sample Documentation Page (Sanitized)

Screenshot of one polished documentation page. Anonymize by:

- Blurring or replacing company-specific tool names with generic equivalents
- Showing page structure, formatting, navigation without revealing proprietary info
- Could show table of contents, code block examples (with dummy code), procedural steps
- Demonstrates writing quality and docs-as-code formatting (admonitions, tabs, code highlighting)
- Consider showing a "Workstation Setup" page as it's less proprietary than deployment pipelines

### Jira Epic Structure

Screenshot of Jira showing your project organization (anonymized):

- Epic: "Engineering Onboarding Documentation Overhaul"
- Stories grouped by theme (Setup, Standards, Resources)
- Use generic story titles: "Document development environment setup", "Create GitHub workflow guide"
- Shows project management approach without revealing specific technical content
- Could blur assignee names and dates if needed

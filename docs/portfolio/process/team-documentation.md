# Knowledge architecture team infrastructure

This case study documents an internal project at CoreWeave where some deliverables cannot be publicly shared. The case study presents the challenge, approach, and impact of the initiative. Artifacts included are either anonymized examples or sanitized mockups that preserve confidentiality while demonstrating the scope and structure of the work.

!!! abstract
    **Role:** Founding team member and process lead  
    **Company:** CoreWeave  
    **Timeline:** Q2 2025  

## Challenge

CoreWeave's newly established knowledge architecture team needed foundational infrastructure to operate effectively. Responsible for documentation, information access, and engineering education, the team required clear processes, role definitions, and shared workflows. Without these foundations, the team risked inefficiency and inconsistency, limiting its ability to succeed at scale.

## Approach

I established the team's operational foundation and standards to create consistency and prepare for growth. This involved:

- **Defining team identity and goals:** Authored a comprehensive team charter outlining our mission, scope, and operational principles
- **Establishing success metrics:** Developed OKRs to align team efforts with organizational priorities
- **Adapting development practices:** Educated the team on applying Git-style review and approval workflows to content creation, and introduced Agile and Scrum methodologies for project management
- **Creating operational processes:** Documented Jira workflows and work intake processes adapted for internal documentation, information access, and engineering enablement
- **Building team documentation infrastructure:** Designed and implemented a navigable Confluence information architecture
- **Developing scalable infrastructure:** Created documentation templates, role definitions, and hiring criteria to support the team's future growth

## Key deliverables

- Team charter defining purpose, scope, and operating principles
- OKR framework for measuring documentation impact
- Jira workflow and work intake process documentation
- Templates for common documentation deliverables
- Role definitions to guide future hiring

## Impact

Establishing this team infrastructure demonstrated how operational foundations enable team effectiveness: I created the processes, standards, and frameworks that transformed a newly formed team into a cohesive, scalable organization.

- **Reduced process confusion** by providing clear, accessible reference documentation for team workflows
- **Created shared baseline** that aligned all team members on expectations and practices
- **Enabled informed growth** with role definitions and processes ready to onboard additional writers
- **Established professional standards** by adapting software development best practices to documentation work

## Artifacts

### Team Charter Structure

Screenshot showing the table of contents or outline of the team charter. Anonymize by:

- Redacting specific team member names (use "Technical Writer 1", "Technical Writer 2", etc.)
- Keeping section headers visible (e.g., "Mission & Vision", "Scope of Work", "Operating Principles", "Stakeholder Relationships")
- Showing the hierarchical structure without revealing company-specific strategic information

### Process Documentation Sample

Example of your Jira workflow or work intake process. Anonymize by:

- Using generic project names ("Project A", "Customer Documentation Request")
- Replacing ticket numbers with placeholders (DOC-XXX)
- Showing the workflow stages and decision points without specific company context
- Could be presented as a flowchart or screenshot of documented process steps

### Template Library Overview

Screenshot of your template collection or a single template. Structure could show:

- List of template types (e.g., "API Reference Template", "How-To Guide Template", "Troubleshooting Template")
- Template metadata (purpose, when to use, owner)
- Could show one template's outline/structure with placeholder content
- Demonstrates your framework thinking without revealing actual documentation

### Documentation Space Organization

Screenshot showing your internal docs navigation or site structure. Anonymize by:

- Showing the hierarchical folder/page structure without specific page titles
- Using generic labels ("Team Processes", "Templates & Standards", "Meeting Notes", "Project Documentation")
- Demonstrating information architecture principles
- Could be a sitemap diagram created in Lucidchart with sanitized labels

# Modern Documentation Engineering

I'm Cole Isaac Garbo, a technical writer and editor based in the northeastern US. My goal is to break complex technical information into clearly communicated content; my passion is developing the human and technical workflows that make *good* documentation *great*.

In practice, I employ a docs-as-code philosophy to create, manage, and publish documentation for modern platforms.

I have a formal and professional education in software development, technical writing, and project organization, with an extensive background in research and behavioral science. This experience makes me uniquely adapted for the challenges faced by the modern technical writer, who must not only author new documentation, but develop publishing pipelines, maintain static sites, and network across teams.

Technical writing exists at a crossroads of **collaboration**, **education**, and **information**. Review my [work experience](./resume.md), [portfolio](./portfolio/index.md), or [projects](./projects.md) to see these pillars in action.
